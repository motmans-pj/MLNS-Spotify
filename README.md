# MLNS-Spotify

Current step: 

1) Continue with data engineering, trying to capture as many of the 'specific' cases as possible to create a reasonably sized graph.
When we are happy with the result, we can just save the edge list and song features into a csv and never run the data engineering again. 
2) Transform song features into artist features. 

Next step: 
Split work in different tasks, node classification, link prediction,...
