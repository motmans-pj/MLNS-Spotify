# MLNS-Spotify

This repository represents the work done for a final project in the course Machine Learning in Network Science at CentraleSupelec.
The goal of the project is to draw insights from the analysis of an artist collaboration network which we constructed using the Spotify database from the following source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-600k-tracks/code?select=tracks.csv

The repository includes three notebooks: 
  * For node classification in which the aim is to predict the genre of an artist
  * For node regression in which the goal is the predict artist popularity
  * For link prediction in which the goal is to predict future collaborations between artists. 
  
The music_utils file contains several helper functions and class definitions used in these notebooks.
